## Note: v1.7.1 of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Ultra+ is the last version that is open source.

I initially open sourced my mods thinking that people could learn how they work, we could share the knowledge, and there have been some good contributions.

However what actually happened, was people started incorporating Ultra+ settings, which are extremely easy to spot, into their Engine.ini mods combined with 150 found settings from Reddit, and without any attribution.

I think users being faced with 50 "performance optimization" and "ultimate visuals" mods shouting loudly that they're the best, is frankly just confusing and frustrating.

On a technical level, there aren't really 50 ways to tune performance or maximise visuals. There probably aren't even 5, or 2.

In the meantime Ultra+ has turned into a team of talented developers and artists working on different games, each having ownership of their own work, yet under the Ultra+ brand, and at a high quality people have come to expect from these mods.

While I still absolutely welcome contribution, this is now done in private by the team on [The Ultra Place](https://discord.gg/ultraplace) Discord. If you have contributed in the past, or would like to, please ping me (or one of our team) in the Discord ðŸ˜Š.
