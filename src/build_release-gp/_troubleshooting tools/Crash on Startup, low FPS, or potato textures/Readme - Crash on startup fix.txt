Occasionally problems occur in the game's configuration files (located in
%LocalAppData%\SilentHill2)

How to tell if you need this fix:
    - Crashing at game launch
    - Crashing loading saved games
    - Low quality textures
    - Low FPS after installing Ultra+ or modifying Engine.ini

The simplest solution is to rename your "%LocalAppData%\SilentHill2\Saved\Config\Windows"
folder. However this is fiddly, so I've created this script to do this automatically.

Note: The script will not delete your ini files, it just renames the folder to
"Windows.old"


Run the script for further instructions (it will confirm before making any changes).
